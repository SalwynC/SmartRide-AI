##  Code is Organized

Everything makes sense:

`
SmartRide-AI/
 client/      What you see (React frontend)
 server/      What runs it (APIs, pricing, bookings)
 shared/      Data types and validation
 script/      Automation tools
`

Three commands do everything:
`ash
npm run dev          # Start working
npm run build        # Ship it
npm run type-check   # Make sure it's safe
`

---

##  Safe & Secret

We configured Git to never commit:
- .env files (your secrets stay secret)
- /docs folder (your local notes)
- Any API keys or passwords

They're ignored. You're safe.
